# Azure Functions quickstart starter sample 

The code in the this repository supports the Azure Functions quickstart topic [Create your first function using the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function-azure-cli). There are three HTTP triggered functions, one each for C#, F#, and JavaScript. These functions are generated from the same HTTP triggered function templates available in the Azure portal.
